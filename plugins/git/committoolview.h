/**
 * This implements the git-cola like toolview for preparing commits.
 *
 * The view contains a list of projects. Each project contains four
 * lists:
 *
 *   - the staged changes list lists all files in the project which
 *     have changes staged for commit;
 *   - the unstaged changes list lists all files in the project which
 *     have changes which are not currently staged for commit;
 *   - the conflicts list lists all files which have unresolved (merge)
 *     conflicts; and
 *   - the untracked list which lists all files not tracked in the VCS
 *
 * Clicking on a file in one of the staged/unstaged lists opens a document
 * tab with the diff showing the changes. The user can then select lines/hunks
 * from the diff and remove/add them from the staged changes using the context menu.
 *
 * Double clicking on a file will, instead, stage/unstage all changes in the file
 * or mark the conflicts as resolved or add the file to be tracked in VCS.
 *
 * Above these lists a lineedit and a textedit may be used to prepare a
 * commit message. The commit button will commit the staged changes to the
 * repo. If several projects are listed, the one which is expanded will be
 * used (only one project is allowed to be expaned to show the lists at a time,
 * an expaned project is automatically collapsed when a different one is expanded).
